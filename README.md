I'm a business operator that has worked in the medical imaging industry for 15 years. I've working in engineering, project management, product management, marketing, supply chain operations, finance, and been GM of a business. My last two jobs (Edison and Clara) have been a development platform for software developers and data scientists to build cloud-native applications and machine learning algorithms.
